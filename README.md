## Ion Schema Schemas

This repository contains schema definitions thought to be widely useful
and serve as good examples of Ion Schema.  Each schema is contained
within a top-level directory.  The collection includes:

* [commons](commons): definitions for some types that are often present in other type systems
* [isl](isl):  schema definition for the Ion Schema Language (ISL) itself
* [json](json): schema definition for Ion that is valid JSON and can be 
  down-converted to JSON and later up-converted back to Ion without any loss of information
